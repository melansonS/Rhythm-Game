**SPACE RHYTHM**
A fun space themed web game designed to become more and more challenging as the game goes on.
Built using HTML, CSS and Object Oriented Javascript.

The goal of the game is to hit the beats as they come across each of the D F  J K keys to acumulate points. If you hit a key too early, or if a beat sneaks by, you lose one of your three lives!

The game gets progressively harder as you play! Build up your streak to increase your point multipliyer and beat your highscore!
